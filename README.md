# Password Manager

This is simple password manager made in python.
It can generate secure passwords, store your login information, copy instantly your email and password to your clipboard for fast use, and bunch more.
Database is stored locally with SqlLite. On linux systems you need xclip for clipboard support.

I made it for myself, it is very convinient and you can backup your database file for other systems.
